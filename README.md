See This project live on this link => https://instagram-clone-kohl.vercel.app/
I have used firebase raectjs material-ui to build this project.

For Installation => Run npm start after cloning the project.

for firebase => create new project on firebase and paste own firebase keys inside config/firebase.js file

for facebook login => create new app on facebook console and paste "APP_ID" and 'SECRET_KEY" inside firebase facebook login.

Thats it.

Happy Coding.
